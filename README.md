# SC1015_MiniProject

## About
Introducing our SC1015 mini-project, where we performed analysis on the [Credit_card dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatmayousufmohamed/credit-card/data). Please view the source code in the following order:

2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/marcyeo/SC1015_MiniProject_Submission/blob/main/exploratory%20data%20analysis.ipynb)
3. Machine learning: [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/marcyeo/SC1015_MiniProject_Submission/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb), [Random Forest](https://github.com/marcyeo/SC1015_MiniProject_Submission/blob/main/randomforest.ipynb), [Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network](https://github.com/marcyeo/SC1015_MiniProject_Submission/blob/main/multilayer%20perceptron%20nn.ipynb), 

## Problem Definition
