# SC1015_MiniProject

## About
Introducing our SC1015 mini-project, where we performed analysis on the [Credit_card dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatmayousufmohamed/credit-card/data). Please view the source code in the following order:
1. [Cleaning and preparation](https://github.com/marcyeo/SC1015_MiniProject_Submission/blob/main/data%20cleaning.ipynb)
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/marcyeo/SC1015_MiniProject_Submission/blob/main/exploratory%20data%20analysis.ipynb)
3. Machine learning: [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/marcyeo/SC1015_MiniProject_Submission/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb), [Random Forest](https://github.com/marcyeo/SC1015_MiniProject_Submission/blob/main/randomforest.ipynb), [Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network](https://github.com/marcyeo/SC1015_MiniProject_Submission/blob/main/multilayer%20perceptron%20nn.ipynb), 

## Problem Definition

# Notebook Details
## Cleaning and Preparation
1. Check and remove missing values, duplicates and outliers within the dataset
2. Remove irrelevant columns: 'Loan ID', 'Customer ID', 'Months since last delinquent'
3. Standardise names of variables

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Numerical Data
2. Categorical Data

## Machine Learning
1. Logistic Regression

2. Random Forest

3. Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network

4. Neural Network for SHAP Analysis
